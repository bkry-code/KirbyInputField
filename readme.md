# Kirby input field replacement

Replacement for Kirbyâ€™s input field.

## What is it?

The replacement input field adds a character counter that indicates whether a field is inside of a min/max range provided in the blueprint.

## Why use it?

It gives panel users a better indication of input length restraints that have been put in place.

## Installation

Place the `input` folder in `/site/fields`.
